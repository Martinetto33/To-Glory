This folder will contain the custom scripts that we write.
Some of them will then be moved to the js/plugins folder.

To add a plugin to your project, open Plugin Manager -> double
click on an empty row, and add the name of your js file, as
specified in this guide:

Then, call the plugin functions from a script.
